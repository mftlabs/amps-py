If the action execution is unsuccessful, a "reason" key can also be returned along with an unsuccessful status. If a new message is intended to be created by this action, it is also expected that a "msg" key will be returned with a dictionary object containing either a "data" key with inline data or an "fpath" key containing the file path to the message. Similarly, actions used in Endpoints can return a "response" object with the response status code specified under the "code" key, and the response body provided via either the "data" or "fpath" key. The action method is automatically wrapped in a try-except block when it is called, so is unnecessary to wrap the overall method in a try-except block. If you wish to have more granular visibility over errors that arise in your actions, feel free to use try-except blocks at various steps throughout action execution to allow for logging specific reasons for failure.

    Attributes:
        parms (dict): The parms attribute contains all the parameters of the configured service.
        sysparms (dict): The sysparms attribute contains all useful system configuration parameters for use in services. Currently, sysparms only contains the AMPS temporary directory under the "tempdir" key. 
        config (dict): The config attribute contains all the custom configuration provided when creating the service. All config is also available in the parms attribute under the "config" key. 
        logger (Logger): The logger attribute exposes a Logger object for logging events back to AMPS. Any messages logged using this object during the message handling or creation will appear in the corresponding session logs. 
        env (string): The name of the AMPS environment in which this service is running.

    The `Service` class provides even more flexibility than the `Action` class in extending the functionality of AMPS. Unlike actions which are run and stopped, services can manage processes such as consumers/subscribers, web servers and sockets, etc, allowing the service to consume messages from and produce messages to AMPS. 

    The class exposes two callback methods, `Service.initialize` and `Service.handle_message`.
    - `initialize` can be used to perform any initialization actions and start any subprocesses. Note that any subprocesses should be started in a separate thread in order to not block the main thread. 
    - `handle_message` can be used to receive messages from the topic specified in the service configuration.

    The class additionally contains two methods for creating messages, `Service.send_message` and `Service.send_new`.
    `Service.send_message` should generally be used in handle_message in order to indicate that the message being created is stemming from the received message.
    Conversely, `Service.send_new` should be used to create new messages originating from an external source, such as a web server or consumer.

    Usage:
    ```
    from amps import Service
    class my_service(Service):
        def initialize(self):
            # Start my subprocess here, potentially passing service reference to subprocess so that it can leverage `send_new`.

            # Maybe deliver this message to my subprocess or use it to process/transform the message.
